# This file instructs travis-ci.org to check that master 'can build' using `grunt can-build` when ever master changes.
# This is to prevent rogue commits/merges on this project that aren't linted.
#
#
# IMPORTANT: both `grunt can-build` and `grunt generate-travis` are specific to this repository's Gruntfile (Found
# https://github.com/brandonLi8/grunt-config/Gruntfile.js). Your repository's Gruntfile must extend to this Gruntfile.
