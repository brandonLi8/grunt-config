# This file instructs travis-ci.org to check that master 'can build' using `grunt can-build` when ever master changes.
# This is to prevent rogue commits/merges on this project that aren't linted.
#
# NOTE!!: both `grunt can-build` and `grunt generate-travis` are specific to this repo's Gruntfile (Found
# https://travis-ci.org/brandonLi8/grunt-config/Gruntfile.js). Your repo's Gruntfile must extend to this Gruntfile.
