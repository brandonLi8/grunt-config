/**
 * Linting utility for running specified linting rules.
 *
 * ## Background
 *  - Linting is process that checks static source code before it is built and ran. Ran through the command line (cli),
 *    linting checks for programmatic and stylistic consistency errors. This helps identify common and uncommon
 *    that are made while modifying the source code.
 *
 * Currently only lints javascript files using ESlint (see https://eslint.org/). However, there are plans to
 * support different file types in the future.
 *
 * The configuration for ESlint can be found ../eslint/.eslintrc.js (relative to this file). It uses some default rules
 * (see documentation: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) but also implements custom rules (see ../eslint/rules).
